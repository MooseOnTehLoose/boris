# Teensy Firmware

This firmware is currently a work in progress. It can be flashed to a teensy-lc via arduino with the teensy plugin enabled: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html

Currently this firmware enables the teensy to recieve PING /send ACK via usb serial, and to update a seven segment display with the current nitra values. Other functionality to be added soon.

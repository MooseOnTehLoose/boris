# B.O.R.I.S
Button Operated Resupply Initiation System

Boris is an in-development project to enable external control of supply drop pod call ins for Deep Rock Galactic. It consists of two components, an application to read the current value of nitra in game and send value updates, and an arduino that is capable of recieving those updates and controlling the ability of the end user to request supply drops based on the current amount of nitra. 


## But Why Tho?

I play Gunner. Gunner's bubble shield is mapped by default to keyboard key 4. Supply Pod is mapped to keyboard key 5. A majority of bubble shields are used reactively during high stress situations and there is a larger than average possibility of mistakes being made while attempting to use one. Since both supply pods and bubble shields are used in the exact same way with potentially no delay, it is easy to accidentally call in a supply pod instead of a life saving shield. B.O.R.I.S is designed to help correct this by separating the supply pod from the keyboard entirely.
